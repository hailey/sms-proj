  <p>TheWords.faith is a communications site and integrated into our <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> server.</p>
  <p>You can connect to the matrix server with any standard matrix client by setting your homeserver to <a href="https://thewords.faith">thewords.faith</a>. <a href="https://thewords.faith">TheWords.faith</a> matrix server should support email verification as well as VoIP and Video calls.</p>
  <p>Any Matrix compattable client will work. There are several web clients such as, <a href="https://fluffychat.im/web/#/home">fluffychat.im</a>. I suggest <a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> for your web browser, it is also a  desktops/ios/android native app.
    Or my favorite for smaller screens, <a href="https://fluffychat.im/en/">fluffychat.im</a> for android/ios.</p>
    <p>For a list of all the clients available check out <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/">matrix clients</a>.</p>
  <p>Right now we are not even in beta, and the service isn't ready for the world yet.
    At least until we get some more testers.</p>
  <p>This site, in the end, will allow users to send text messages to the US for a low monthly fee.
    This allows businesses or end users who want privacy minded or a business sms number that
    allows you to stay in touch with your customers by providing SMS and eventually MMS support.</p>
    <h3>This is a public service. There are no logs stored only encrypted datasets. Please be respectful to everyone and their equipment as this is provided as a public service.</h3>

  <p>We are still looking for testers or developers so, if you're interested and don't mind a work
    in progress, then maybe you can help out by sending an email to submit at athnex dot com. Or better yet, message me on our
  <a href='https://github.com/hailey/sms-proj'>GitHub</a>. This is a side project of mine so development will be slow
  for as long as its only me. Thanks for your interest!</p>
